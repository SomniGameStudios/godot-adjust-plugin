class_name AdjustDemoState
extends RefCounted

# Process-persistent demo state. Adjust is a per-process singleton, but each demo
# scene is freed on navigation, so its status label would otherwise forget that
# initialize() already succeeded. These statics survive scene changes and let a
# scene restore a truthful dot in _ready(). Set only from the confirmed
# initialization_completed callback — never guessed.
